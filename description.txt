# Class Experiment_data

This objects of this class has 3 fields (value, abolute error, relative error)

# Function get_data(road_to_file, colomn_with_x, colomn_with_y, start_line, finish_line, sheet_number=0)

This function needs a few paraments:
    1. road_to_file  - road to Excel file, which consist data
    2. colomn_with_x - colomn with independent variable
    3. colomn_with_y - colomn with dependent variable
    4. start_line    - line from which you want to start read data
    5. finish_line   - line on which  you want to finish read data
    6. sheet_number  - number of sheet with data, which you want to read !!! Default - 0 !!!

And as answer this one returns:
    1. x_list - array with independent variable
    2. y_list - array with dependent variable
    3. name   - name of file (!!! without format !!!)

# Function error(x, y, system_error)

This function get 3 parametrs:
    1. x - array with independent variable
    2. y - array with dependent variable
    3. system_error - system error in your's experiment

And as answer this one returns:
    1. x - array with independent variable
    2. y - array with dependent variable

    !!! Both arrays consist data in Experiment_data type !!!
    This mean, that each object of those arrays has 3 fields ( value, absolute error, relative error )

# Function MSL(x,y)

This is function of Method of Less Square

This function get 2 parametrs:
    1. x - array with independent variable
    2. y - array with dependent variable

Based on this data this function returns:
    1. result - the function which is best describes the dependence between data
    2. draw_data - array which consist pars (x;y), which could be used in plot function
        a. draw_data[0] = function ( format of this is str )
        b. draw_data[1] = array[ [x_list], [y_list] ]

# Function plot_f(x, y, draw_data, function, name, road='./pictures')

This function get:
    1. x - array with data from experiment
    2. y - array with data from experiment
    3. draw_data - data for plot function
    4. function - name of function we drawing ( we got this from MSL() )
    5. name - name how you want to call the graphics
    6. road - location on your computer to save graphics ( Default - )
